# Learning something new

You open the manual. On the first page ... hey this doesn't seem so hard ! 

something comes up you haven't seen before ... no worries, I'll read about that later...

but then more of those come up ... and more ... and more ... and now you're like what do I even need to know ? what's important ? 

And then you're just so confused at where to even start.

I'm here to tell you that's normal.

And that you are going to turn up a lot of false leaves. Things you waste time reading that may not end up being relevant. If you abandon the concept that you're going to be able to figure out the path to solving anything immediately you'll be much happier for it. Assume you're going to turn up a couple of wrong turns. The trick is to just keep moving.

## Ultimate Level Prep

"Moreover, Spring Boot introduces the @SpringBootApplication annotation. This single annotation is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan."

"As a result, when we run this Spring Boot application, it will automatically scan the components in the current package and its sub-packages. Thus it will register them in Spring's Application Context, and allow us to inject beans using @Autowired."
