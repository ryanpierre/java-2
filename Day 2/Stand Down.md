# Stand Down

**What are you excited to do in the sun ? **

**Things that were hard today ?**

- Motivation
- Data Types - Arrays ? Lists ? ArrayLists ? Arrays !?!?! ðŸ¤¯
  - So many things to pay attention to !
  - Mutable vs Immutable: Immutability is for data safety
- Get back into learning 9-5!
- General syntax ðŸ˜­
- Knowing the principle of what you want to do but don't knwo how to translate it to java
- Alot of effort for very little code
- "chuffed" about tests passing (unknown word to canadians)
- Reset back to level 1 after time off from bootcamp
- Realize the importance of doing small bit of coding every days 
- Needing to tell a method that it throws an error, but the test needs to know as well
    - Needs to know that it throws an error even though it doesn't actually execute the error code for that particular test
- Testing in general, looking at tutorials but theyre all a little bit different. Studying testing directly but hard to get into. 
- How to call another class from within your class 

getting back into daZone


- Running feature tests e.g. IRB in Ruby
--> a) i was in a meeting
but b) i thought this would be good to talk about

Running code in IRB is meant as a way to debug, not validate tests.


## Does it all feel worth it yet ?

- A little bit like a chore at the moment


- Array vs List thing ðŸ¤® <---- 

- ["gsd", "gsdg"] push pop shift() <---  ArrayList 
- Whys it called an Array ?

# ruby time ðŸ˜Ž

my_array = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish'].freeze

# java
