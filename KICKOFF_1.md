- What makes Java so popular ?

      Important points:
      - JVM Portability
      - 20 Years of colective braintrust. without knowing it a lot of the code we write in javascript for example (and especially TS) is deeply influenced by java
- Compiled vs. Interpreted languages ?

        Important Points:
      - Do they compile to Bytecode ? Run directly ?
      - Interactive REPL ? Technically ...
      - Compiler errors
- Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed ? *(Remember: Lisps are an example of compiled, dynamically typed languages !)*

        Important Points:
      - Ruby, Python, Javascript
      - Java, C++, TypeScript
      - Lisps
