What was a struggle today ? What challenged you ? 
- Last minute personal stuff
- Overloading of too many things all at once and how its all connected
- Difficult to find a best way of doing things when googling
- Don't have the background knowledge to jump into a project like twitter
- Too many way to approach a solution <-- "Do I use a database for my integration tests"
- especially not knowing which libraries are part of legacy and which one are more in time.
